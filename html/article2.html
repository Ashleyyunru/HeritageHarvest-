<p class="content"><strong>Pomegranates are low in calories and fat but high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Benefits include antioxidants, heart health, urinary health, exercise endurance, and more.</strong></p>
	
	<p class="content">Pomegranates are round, red fruits. They feature a white inner flesh that’s packed with crunchy, juicy edible seeds called arils.

They may be best known for the vibrantly colored juice they’re often used in, but these unique fruits have a lot more to offer.

This article examines the many health benefits of pomegranates.

</p>

	
<p>.</p>


	<p class="content"><strong>Packed with nutrients</strong>
	<p/>
	
<p class="content">Overall, pomegranates are low in calories and fat but high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

Below is the nutrition for the arils in oneTrusted Source average pomegranate:

<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Calories: 234</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Protein: 4.7 grams (g)</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Fat: 3.3 g</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Carbohydrates: 52 g</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Fiber: 11.3 g</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Vitamin C: 32% of the Daily Value (DV)</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Folate: 27% of the DV</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Magnesium: 8% of the DV</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Phosphorus: 8% of the DV</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Potassium: 13% of the DV</strong></p></li></ul>
	
<p class="content">Keep in mind that the nutritional information for pomegranate and arils differsTrusted Source from that of pomegranate juice, which won’t provide much fiber or vitamin C.<p/>
	 
	
	<p></p>

<p class="content"><strong>How to Prepare Pomegranates?</strong>
<p/> 
	
	<p class="content">Roll the fruit first to loosen the seeds.
Score around the middle and tear it open into halves. Take care not to cut through into the seeds, just the skin.
Hold each half over a bowl, seeds facing down and tap the skin with a wooden spoon, squeezing a little to release the seeds.
Alternatively, score four lines from top to bottom to quarter the pomegranate.
Submerge the pomegranate in a bowl of water and and pull apart the quarters, releasing the seeds with your hands.
The pith will float and the seeds will sink. Remove the pith and discard, then drain the seeds.<p/>

<p class="content"><strong>1. Rich in antioxidants</strong>
<p/> 

<p class="content">Antioxidants are compounds that help protect the cells of your body from damage caused by free radicals. High amounts of free radicals can be harmful and contribute to a number of chronic diseases.

Pomegranates are richTrusted Source in antioxidants and polyphenolic compounds, including punicalagins, anthocyanins, and hydrolyzable tannins.

Getting antioxidants from fruits such as pomegranates is a great way to support overall health and prevent disease.<p/> 
	
	<p></p>
	
	<p class="content"><strong>2. May have anticancer properties</strong>

<p class="content">ResearchTrusted Source has found that compounds in pomegranate have anti-cancer properties.

Animal researchTrusted Source has also found that pomegranate helps slow tumor growth in the early stages of liver cancer.

Plus, according to older researchTrusted Source, pomegranate extract may be beneficial for prostate cancer.<p/> 
	
<p></p>
	
<p class="content"><strong>3. May offer heart health benefits</strong>
<p class="content">There is evidenceTrusted Source that fruits rich in polyphenolic compounds, such as pomegranate, may benefit heart health.

For example, in a studyTrusted Source on people with heart disease, drinking pomegranate juice reduced the frequency and severity of chest pain, as well as certain biomarkers that suggest a protective effect on heart health</p>
<p></p>
	
	<p class="content"><strong>4. Support urinary health</strong>
<p class="content">Test-tube and human studies have found that pomegranate extract may help reduce the formation of kidney stones.

In one 2014 studyTrusted Source, pomegranate extract was found to inhibit the mechanism associated with stone formation in people with recurrent kidney stones.

Additionally, animal studiesTrusted Source have found that pomegranate extract can help regulate the concentration of oxalates, calcium, and phosphates in the blood, which are common components of kidney stones.</p>
<p></p>
	
	<p class="content"><strong>5. May have antimicrobial properties</strong>
<p class="content">Pomegranate compounds may helpTrusted Source fight harmful microorganisms.

For instance, they may protectTrusted Source oral health by reducing the growth of germs that can contribute to bad breath and tooth decay.</p>
<p></p>
	
	<p class="content"><strong>6. May improve exercise endurance</strong>
<p class="content">The polyphenols in pomegranates may increase exercise endurance.

One small studyTrusted Source found that pomegranate extract increased time to exhaustion and improved performance in trained cyclists.

Other researchTrusted Source has found that pomegranate supplements may improve both endurance and muscle recovery.

However, researchTrusted Source using pomegranate juice has found no benefit for muscle recovery after exercise, indicating that more studies are needed.</p>
<p></p>
	
<p class="content"><strong>7. Good for your brain</strong>
<p class="content">Pomegranates contain antioxidants called ellagitannins, which help reduce inflammation in the body.

Some studiesTrusted Source have found that ellagitannins may help protectTrusted Source the brain against Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease by reducing oxidative damage and increasing the survival of brain cells.

Ellagitannins are believed to produce a compound in the gut called urolithin A, which has been studied for its ability to reduce inflammationTrusted Source in the brain and delay the onset of cognitive diseases.

Nonetheless, more research is needed.</p>
<p></p>	
	
<p class="content"><strong>8. Supports digestive health</strong>
<p class="content">Eating pomegranate may helpTrusted Source support the health of your gut microbiome, which plays a key role in many aspects of health.

Test-tube researchTrusted Source has found that pomegranate can increase levels of beneficial gut bacteria, suggesting that it may have prebiotic effects.

Prebiotics serve as fuel for the beneficial bacteria in your gut and support a healthier gut microbiome.

Additionally, pomegranate arils are rich in fiber, which is essentialTrusted Source for digestive health and may protect against some digestive conditions.</p>
