	<p class="content">Medical inflation is happening around the world. The medical industry is experiencing unprecedented advancements in medical technologies and pharmaceutical research— compounded by an increased demand for highly skilled healthcare professionals.These advancements are inadvertently leading to higher healthcare costs globally, which, in turn, result in higher medical inflation. Additionally, the ageing population and increased prevalence of chronic diseases are exerting pressure on healthcare spendingWith inflated healthcare costs, healthcare expenses are consuming an ever growing portion of national budgets. So, how does medical insurance play a role in combating medical inflation and alleviating its economic effects?.With inflated healthcare costs, healthcare expenses are consuming an ever-growing portion of national budgets.So, how does medical insurance play a role in combating medical inflation and alleviating its economic effects?</p>

	<p class="content"><strong>What is medical inflation?</strong>
	<p/>
	
<p class="content">Medical inflation is a phenomenon that denotes the rate at which the cost of healthcare services and products increase over time. Medical inflation considerably impacts healthcare prices for individuals, employers, and governments, making it less affordable and reducing access to care for some people.Medical inflation is usually measured via indices like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) that can be leveraged to measure annual price changes for medical services. In practice, the CPI measures annual price changes for each item in a basket of medical goods or services. On the other hand, the PPI considers changes in medical industry output costs with a focus on actual transaction prices.<p/>

<p class="content"><strong>Medical inflation in Malaysia</strong>
<p/>  

	<p class="content">The World Bank reports that healthcare expenditure in Malaysia has been increasing over the years. In fact, in 2006, healthcare expenditure in relation to GDP was 3.3%, in stark contrast to the 4.1% figure estimated in 2020.Furthermore, insurers in Malaysia are projecting a continued increase in medical expenditure from 12.9% in 2022 to 13.8% in 2023, according to WTW's 2023 Global Medical Trends Survey. The survey reports that the three major drivers of medical costs in the country are:Overuse of medical care with professionals recommending too many services or overprescribing. Insured members' poor health habits. The underuse of preventive services.
Other influences on medical inflation in Malaysia are the high cost of imported medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, an ageing population, policy design, and a high prevalence of non-communicable diseases.<p/>

<p class="content"><strong>Medical inflation vs. general inflation</strong>
<p/> 

<p class="content">Medical inflation and general inflation are two disparate concepts that share some similarities. For starters, medical inflation refers to a statistical metric which measures the rate the cost of healthcare services increases over time. General inflation is a broader economic phenomenon that denotes the overall increase in the prices of goods and services across various economic sectors. General inflation is influenced by factors like changes in consumer demand, the money supply, changes in the cost of labour, and economic conditions. In practice, medical inflation is a sub-component of general inflation. In fact, medical inflation is usually compared to general inflation in order to determine how much faster the cost of healthcare services is increasing in contrast to the cost of goods and services in the general economy. However, medical inflation is usually higher than general inflation. This means that the cost of health services and products typically increases at a faster rate than the cost of goods and services in the overall economy.<p/>

	<p class="content"><strong>How will rising inflation affect healthcare?</strong>

<p class="content">Rising inflation increases the cost of healthcare services and products, making healthcare less affordable for private individuals, employers, and governments.Rising inflation may also result in reduced healthcare access for the uninsured or underinsured— which could lead to worse health outcomes. In fact, as healthcare costs increase, some chronic patients may skip medical appointments, or miss prescriptions because of cost concerns.<p/>

<p class="content"><strong>What can you do to counter medical inflation in Malaysia?</strong>
<p class="content">There are some practical ways to combat medical inflation and ensure that you have continuous and affordable healthcare.</p>
<p></p>
	
	<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Obtain health insurance.</strong></p></li></ul>
<p class="content">One of the primary steps to help counter medical inflation is to get comprehensive health insurance coverage. With health insurance, you will be able to access healthcare services without bearing the full brunt of rising medical costs.</p>


<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Revise your health insurance plan.</strong></p></li></ul>
<p class="content">If you already have a health insurance plan, consider reviewing it regularly to ensure it still meet your needs. For context, as you age, you may need to adjust your coverage to accommodate new treatments and medications. Additionally, you can even consider switching to a plan with higher deductibles or a health savings account to help manage costs.</p>

<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Keep up with rising costs.</strong></p></li></ul>
<p class="content">It is imperative to keep abreast with the rising healthcare costs in order to financially prepare for potential out-of-pocket expenses. Setting up a healthcare emergency fund may even help mitigate the impact of unexpected medical bills.</p>

<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Ensure you're protected long-term.</strong></p></li></ul>
<p class="content">Consider signing up for long-term care insurance to manage the cost of long-term care services, even in retirement. Long-term coverage may help cover the cost of extended healthcare not conventionally included in standard health insurance.</p>

<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Ensure you’re covered for the latest treatment and medication.</strong></p></li></ul>
<p class="content">Choose a plan that ensures you’re covered for the latest treatments and medications that may be available for your condition. For example, Prudential offers precision medicine for cancer, a cancer insurance coverage for leading-edge cancer treatment tailored to your recovery needs.</p>

<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Create healthy lifestyle habits.</strong></p></li></ul>
<p class="content">Adopt healthy lifestyle habits, like maintaining a balanced diet, stress management through therapy, avoiding smoking, exercising daily, and getting enough sleep. These habits may help prevent the emergence of chronic diseases and appreciably mitigate the need for expensive medical care.</p>
