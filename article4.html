<p class="content"><strong>Salmon has several health benefits. Having at least 2 servings a week can help you meet your nutrient needs and reduce the risk of several diseases.</strong></p>
	
	<p class="content">healthier just a little bit easier — and more fun!
Salmon is one of the most nutritious foods on the planet.

This popular fatty fish is not only loaded with nutrients but also may reduce certain risk factors for several diseases.

What’s more, it’s tasty, versatile, and widely available.This article will explore some of the key benefits of salmon, along with a few easy ways to add it to your diet.

	<p class="content"><strong>Salmon nutrition facts</strong>
	<p/>
	
<p class="content">The nutritional value of salmon can vary slightly among the varieties. For example, farmed salmon contains slightly more healthy fats and calories, whereas wild-caught salmon is a bit higher in protein. However, both types are great sources of many key nutrients, including selenium, phosphorus, and B vitamins. Here is a closer look at the nutritional value for a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of cooked wild or farmed salmon. Salmon is particularly high in selenium, an Important nutrient that is involved in DNA synthesis, thyroid hormone metabolism, and reproductive health. It’s also a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, a type of heart-healthy fat that can decrease inflammation and support brain health. What’s more, salmon is rich in vitamin B12, which is necessary for producing red blood cells and regulating the health of the central nervous system. <p/> 

	<p></p>
	

	
	<p class="content"><strong>1. Rich in omega-3 fatty acids</strong>
	<p/>
	
<p class="content">Salmon is one of the best sources of the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) portion of farmed salmon has 2.3 grams of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, while the same portion of wild salmon contains 2.2 grams. Unlike most other fats, omega-3 fats are considered “essential,” meaning you must get them from your diet since your body cannot create them.

Generally, most health organizations recommend that healthy adults get a minimum of 250–1,000 mg of combined EPA and DHA per day. EPA and DHA have been credited with several impressive health benefits, such as decreasing inflammation, lowering blood pressure, reducing the risk of cancer, and improving the function of the cells that line your arteries. One review of 22 studies found that using an EPA and DHA supplement consistently could significantly improve arterial function, especially in people who smoke, are overweight, or have high cholesterol levels or metabolic syndrome. What’s more, studies have shown that getting these omega-3 fats from fish increases levels in your body even more effectively than supplementing with fish oil capsules. As for how much fish to eat, consuming at least two servings of salmon per week can help you meet your omega-3 fatty acid needs.<p/> 

	
		<p class="content"><strong>2. Great source of protein</strong>
	<p/>
	
	<p class="content">Salmon is rich in high quality protein.

Like omega-3 fats, protein is an essential nutrient that you must get from your diet.

Protein plays a number of important roles in your body, including helping you heal after injury, protecting bone health, and maintaining muscle mass during weight loss and as you get older<p/> 
	
	<p></p>
	

	
	<p class="content"><strong>3. High in B vitamins</strong>
	<p/>
	
	<p class="content">Salmon is an excellent source of B vitamins.

Below is the B vitamin content in 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of wild salmon:<p/> 

<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Vitamin B12: more than 100% of the DV</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Niacin: 63% of the DV</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Vitamin B6: 56% of the DV</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Riboflavin: 38% of the DV</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Pantothenic acid: 38% of the DV</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Thiamine: 23% of the DV</strong></p></li></ul>
<ul class="a"><li><p class="content"><strong>Folic acid: 7% of the DV</strong></p></li></ul>

	
<p class="content">These vitamins are involved in several important processes in your body, including turning the food you eat into energy, creating and repairing DNA, and reducing chronic inflammation, which can lead to disease

<p/>
	 
	
	<p></p>

<p class="content"><strong>4. May reduce the risk of heart disease</strong>
<p/> 
	
	<p class="content">Eating salmon on a regular basis may help protect against heart disease. This is due, in large part, to salmon’s ability to boost levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the blood. Many people have too many omega-6 fatty acids in their blood in relation to omega-3s. Research suggests that when the balance of these two fatty acids is off, the risk of heart disease increases. In one older study, consuming 2 servings of farmed salmon per week increased omega-3 blood levels by 8–9% and decreased omega-6 levels after 4 weeks. Additionally, some research suggests that regular consumption of fish may be linked to lower triglyceride levels and improvements in several other risk factors for heart disease. <p/>  
	
	<p></p>

<p class="content"><strong>5. May benefit weight management</strong>
<p/> 
	
	<p class="content">Consuming salmon frequently can help you lose weight and keep it off.

Like other high protein foods, it helps regulate the hormones that control appetite and help you feel full.

In addition, your metabolic rate temporarily increases more after eating protein-rich foods, such as salmon, compared with other foods .

Plus, research suggests that the omega-3 fats in salmon and other fatty fish may promote weight loss and decrease belly fat in people with obesity when combined with an active lifestyle, though more research is needed.

One study in children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease found that supplementing with DHA, the main omega-3 found in salmon, led to significantly greater reductions in liver fat and belly fat compared with a placebo.

In addition, salmon is fairly low in calories. A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of farmed salmon has only 206 calories, and wild salmon has even fewer at 182 calories <p/>
	
	
	<p></p>

<p class="content"><strong>6. May protect brain health</strong>
<p/> 
	
	<p class="content">A growing number of studies suggest that including salmon in your diet might improve brain function.

Both fatty fish and fish oil have been found to protect fetal brain health during pregnancy, slow cognitive decline, and preserve brain function, 51Trusted Source.

One review found that consuming at least 2 servings of fish per week was associated with a 10% lower risk of dementia and a 30% lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease.

Another 2020 review concluded that fish consumption could improve memory performance, promote brain function, and protect brain structure in healthy adults. <p/>  
	
	
	<p></p>

<p class="content"><strong>7.Can improve mental health</strong>
<p/> 
	
	<p class="content">In addition to protecting brain health, some promising studies suggest that salmon could support mental health, thanks to its content of omega-3 fatty acids.

According to a review of 10 studies, consuming at least 1 serving of fish per week or 500 mg of omega-3 fatty acids per day was associated with a lower risk of depression, especially in women.

However, more high quality randomized control trials are needed.

Another small study in 23 young adults found that taking an omega-3 fatty acid supplement led to significant improvements in symptoms of depression after 21 days.

Some research also suggests that omega-3 fatty acids could reduce symptoms of anxiety and improve mood, though more studies are needed. <p/>  
	
	
	<p class="content"><strong>8.May help maintain healthy vision</strong>
<p/> 

<p class="content">Salmon contains several nutrients necessary for promoting eye health and maintaining vision.

For example, astaxanthin has been studied in humans and animals for its ability to prevent certain disorders that can affect eye health, including age-related macular degeneration, eye fatigue, uveitis, and cataracts.

Salmon also contains a good amount of vitamin A in each serving, with around 8% of the DV in a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of farmed salmon.

Vitamin A is essential for vision and is a precursor for certain pigment molecules in the photoreceptors of the eye.

What’s more, other research suggests that omega-3 fatty acids could be beneficial for the treatment of dry eye disease.

<p class="content"><strong>How to incorporate more salmon into your diet</strong>
<p/> 

<p class="content">A healthy way for incorporating salmon into your diet: If you're looking to cook a large fillet of salmon on the grill, wrap it in foil! It's much easier to manage this way, and you'll get a tender piece of fish that is impressive looking. This method takes about 14 to 18 minutes and feel free to add veggetables of your choice.
